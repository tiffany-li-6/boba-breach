/*
 * DesktopLauncher.java
 *
 * LibGDX is a cross-platform development library. You write all of your code in
 * the core project.  However, you still need some extra classes if you want to
 * deploy on a specific platform (e.g. PC, Android, Web).  That is the purpose
 * of this class.  It deploys your game on a PC/desktop computer.
 *
 * The only really important part of this file is the method configureApplication.
 * That is where you set your application specific settings.  Everything else
 * should be left alone (except the package, which must be tailored to your
 * application).
