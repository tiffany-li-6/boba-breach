/*
 * LoadingScene.java
 *
 * Asset loading is a really tricky problem. If you have a lot of sound or
 * images, it can take a long time to decompress them and load them into memory.
 * If you just have code at the start to load all your assets, your game will
 * look like it is hung at the start.
 *
 * The alternative is asynchronous asset loading. In asynchronous loading, you
 * load a little bit of the assets at a time, but still animate the game while
 * you are loading. This way the player knows the game is not hung, even though
 * he or she cannot do anything until loading is complete. You know those
 * loading screens with the inane tips that want to be helpful? That is
 * asynchronous loading.
 *
 * This player mode provides a basic loading screen. While you could adapt it
 * for between level loading, it is currently designed for loading all assets
 * at the start of the game.
